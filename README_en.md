This software is open-source and free, intended for personal learning and communication purposes only. Do not use it for any commercial or profit-making activities. The development team reserves the right of final interpretation. Any issues arising from the use of this software are not the responsibility of this project or its developers.

  <img src="docs/images/image_2.png" alt="International Server Language Setting" />

## 🔧 Usage Guide

1. **International Server Players**: Set "Game Language" to "繁体中文" (Traditional Chinese) in the bottom-left settings page
2. **Auto Battle**: Depends on keybind recognition; enable shortcut key display in game settings for better accuracy
3. **Chaos Mode**: Enable auto-battle and auto-story features within the game
4. **Story Mode**: Manually enable Sortie Mode for battle stages; manually enable Chaos Mode for chaos stages; battle stage teams must be configured manually

### ADB Device Mode

1. Enable Developer Options and USB debugging on the Android device, connect it by USB, and accept the debugging authorization prompt.
2. Open the game manually, use a landscape 16:9 resolution, and keep the device unlocked.
3. Refresh the device list on the app's home page. Authorized devices appear as "Android Connected"; unauthorized, offline, or missing devices show a troubleshooting row at the top of the list.
4. If the row says USB debugging is unauthorized, unlock the phone, select "Always allow" in the USB debugging prompt, tap "Allow", and refresh again.
5. For wireless ADB, pair and connect the device with the system ADB tools first, then refresh the device list in the app.

ADB mode does not change the device resolution or launch a channel-specific game package. Make sure the game is in the foreground before starting a task.
Phone screenshots can be wider than 16:9. Phone mode skips the Windows-only 16:9 startup gate while retaining the framework's widescreen coordinate adaptation.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, please check the following steps one by one before asking for help:

1. **Antivirus Software**: Add the software's installation directory to the **exceptions or whitelist** of your antivirus software (including Windows Defender) to prevent files from being mistakenly deleted or blocked.
2. **Display Settings**:
   * Turn off all graphics card filters (like NVIDIA Game Filter) and sharpening features.
   * Use the game's default brightness settings.
   * Disable any overlays that display information on the game screen.
3. **Game Resolution**: Ensure the game resolution is set to a 16:9 aspect ratio.
4. **Software Version**: Check and ensure you are using the latest version.
5. **Getting Help**: If the steps above do not solve your problem, please submit a detailed bug report through our community channels.
